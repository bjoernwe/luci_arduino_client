# Luci Light

![Luci light blinking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bjoernwe/luci_arduino/master/luci.gif)

A little hack consisting of an Arduino and [Adafruit NeoPixels](https://www.adafruit.com/category/168) that is bright enough to
create colorful fractal patterns in front of your closed eyes. Inspiried by the comercially sold 
[Lucia](http://www.lucialightexperience.com/) light.
