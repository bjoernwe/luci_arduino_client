# Luci Light

![Luci light blinking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bjoernwe/luci_arduino/master/luci.gif)

This is a little proof-of-concept to reproduce the _"hypnagogic"_ effects of a ~$30k [Lucia](http://www.lucialightexperience.com/) lamp with an Arduino microcontroller and some programmable LEDs ([Adafruit NeoPixels](https://www.adafruit.com/category/168)).

This repository contains code for a Python GUI that communicates with the corresponding Arduino code (https://github.com/bjoernwe/luci_arduino/) to adjust the LED's brightness, frequency, and color.
